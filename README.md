## Description
This is my "first" GitHub repo for my CS 2400 class. It's supposed to be our
very first repo after creating a GitHub account, but this isn't my first repo
nor is this GitHub account new at all (it's had some history alright!).

## So what's in this repo?
This program is a vibe-coded note taking app written in Java using Swing for
its UI. It only keeps notes in memory, so it isn't actually a usable app.
That's fine, however, as it suffices for the purposes of this assignment.

Normally, I do **not** use AI. However, since it's part of the assignment
instructions, I'm making this as a disclaimer in case anyone is snooping around
my account (maybe you're following me and checking this out, etc).

## What do I have planned for this repo?
To correct AI's mistakes. That's about it.

Maybe one of these days I'll make a proper note-taking app that supports
rich-text. It certainly won't be in Java though.

## Building

Ensure you have Java installed. Building (and running) is as simple as this:

```
$ java SimpleSwingNoteApp.java
```

## License
Well, this _is_ for an assignment, so I'm not sure I have authority to license
this project. However, if I _do_ have authority to license this project, then
this project is made available under the Unlicense license.
